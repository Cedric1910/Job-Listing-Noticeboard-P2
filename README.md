# Job-Listing-Noticeboard-P2

COSC349 Assignment 2 Developed by Hugo Baird, Cedric Stephani

This application aims to give users a platform to post available job positions using a form which then gets displayed on the noticeboard where job-seekers can find work in a simple and reliable way. This is the second part of our original assignment with focus on deploying the application publicly using AWS.
